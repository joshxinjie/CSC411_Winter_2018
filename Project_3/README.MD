# Project 3: Fake News!

Build and analyze several algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression) for determining whether a headline is real or fake news. Naive Bayes algorithm will be implemented from scratch with just numpy, while scikit-learn will be used for Decision Tree algorithm and Pytorch will be used for the Logistic Regression algorithm.
