# Project 2: Deep Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit and Face Recognition

Build several neural networks of varying depth, and use them for handwritten digit recognition and face recognition. The network for the handwritten digit recognition is implemented from scratch with just numpy, while Pytorch will be used for the network for face recognition.

The detailed requirements for the project can be found at [link](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc411h/winter/projects/proj2/).
