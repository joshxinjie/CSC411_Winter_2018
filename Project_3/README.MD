# Project 3: Fake News!

## Description
Build and analyze several algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression) for determining whether a news headline is real or fake news. Naive Bayes algorithm will be implemented from scratch with just numpy, while scikit-learn will be used for Decision Tree algorithm and Pytorch will be used for the Logistic Regression algorithm.

The dataset provided are a subset of the Kaggle datasets "Getting Real about Fake News" and "A Million News Headlines".

The main programming tasks for this project are:

Task 1: Implement Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch. Train and test the algorithm on classifying news headlines.

Results:
* Train Accuracy: 96.94%
* Valid Accuracy: 87.73%
* Test Accuracy: 82.86%

Task 2: Implement Logistic Regression model with Pytorch. Train and test the algorithm on classifying news headlines.
Results:
* Train Accuracy: 98.69%
* Valid Accuracy: 86.30%
* Test Accuracy: 82.65%


Task 3: Implement Decison Tree classifier with Scikit-Learn. Train and test the algorithm on classifying news headlines.
Results:
* Train Accuracy: 98.12%
* Valid Accuracy: 78.12%
* Test Accuracy: 76.94%
